Registration at RBG Kew is now close due to room capacity limitations. Inquiries for a waiting list can be directed to George Tiley (g[dot]tiley[at]kew[dot]org) as spaces may become available.

Registration at RBG Edinburgh is still open and can be completed through a google form. Registration is free.
