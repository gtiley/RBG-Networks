To maximize time for hands-on activities, all participants should install the required software outlined in [Pre-Workshop](https://gtiley.github.io/Botany2023-Networks/reading/) in advance. In cases where installs prove difficult, participants should reach out to instructors before the workshop for troubleshooting. People will be available for real-time assistance throughout the workshop too.<br>
